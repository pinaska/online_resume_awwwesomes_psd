# we_create website
This project one-page html-css only website is to practise my HTML and CSS skills. 
* The project has been started on Canada Learning Code workshop, 17.02.2018 and developed since then.
* psd file by [The Awwwesomes](http://theawwwesomes.org/)

## technologies used:
* SASS partials
* Gulp task runner
    * npm install, gulp-sourcemaps, gulp-eslint,gulp-uglify, gulp-cssnano, gulp-prettyerror, gulp-rename, browser-sync(check, why it is not working at my comp)
* CSS grid and flexbox

### personal learnings:
I wanted to make this one page site responsive with mobile-first approach. All the CSS styling is written for three screen widths: mobile, min-width:620px and min-width:1080px (sass mixins used).
Please let me know, if you find any responsivnes issue.

* to-do: validate, check accessibility and performance
